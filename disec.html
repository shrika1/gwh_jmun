“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever.” – George Orwell<br><br>
Around six years of experience in MUN/Debate. She thrives in political and legal discussions. You may catch her listening to dad-rock when she's not knee-deep in academics.

“When power corrupts, poetry cleanses.” – JFK<br><br>
Vanya has achieved several placements across muns including this very JMUN previously. She facilitates chaotic but highly productive debate and famously never needs a microphone. Outside MUNs you can find her drawing spider-man and constantly travelling or plotting to live in london!

    Diplomacy is the art of telling people to go to hell in such a way that they ask for directions. 
  — Winston Churchill
<br><br>Siddhant has gained valuable experience through participation in Model United Nations conferences, developing strong skills in diplomacy, public speaking, and critical analysis. Through formal debates and collaborative negotiations, he learned to research international issues thoroughly and present well-structured arguments. These experiences helped him build confidence, leadership, and the ability to work effectively under pressure while respecting diverse perspectives. Overall, his participation in MUN significantly enhanced his global awareness and communication skills
