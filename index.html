                <h2 class="section-title">Letter from the Secretary General</h2>
                <p class="salutation">Dear Delegates,</p>

                <p>It is my honour to welcome you to the Greenwood High Junior Model United Nations Conference 2026.</p>

                <p>Greenwood High’s MUN conferences are nothing short of intellectual battlegrounds, and our Junior MUN is no exception. From impactful speeches to research that rivals that of seasoned scholars, Junior MUN has consistently proven to be the birthplace of the circuit’s brightest and most promising.</p>

                <p>While Model United Nations is often perceived as a competition of global engagement and debate, where delegates showcase their understanding of current affairs while attempting not to crack under the Executive Board’s watchful eye, in reality, our conference is far more than that. It is a platform for both intellectual and personal advancement. From long hours of research to the split seconds of bated breath before delivering a speech, every moment presents an opportunity to learn, evolve, and grow.</p>

                <p>For me, MUN was far more than a competition; it was a space to cultivate friendships that I continue to treasure throughout my journey in the circuit. Few experiences create bonds as strong as the rush of a press session, the pride of sponsorship, or the joy of a hard-earned win. MUN has transformed the way I approach problems, communicate ideas, and, most importantly, taught me the immense value of collaboration.</p>

                <p>As your Secretary General, I take immense pride in witnessing the evolution of this conference, from its humble ideation to the remarkable culmination of effort you now see. I firmly believe that these efforts are never in vain, because if even one delegate leaves feeling more knowledgeable, more eloquent, or simply more confident, then the purpose of this conference has been fulfilled.</p>

                <p>First-timer or seasoned delegate alike, this conference is a hub of growth, opportunity, and discovery. So, delegates, I leave you with this message: seize the day and work together to confront the global challenges that shape our world. Remember, we didn’t start the fire, but we cannot afford to put it out with leaky buckets.</p>

                <p>May the odds be ever in your favour.</p>

        <div class="closing">
            <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
            <p class="signature">Suhani Singh<br>
            Secretary General - GWH JMUN 2026</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Letter from the Director General</h2>
                  <p class="salutation">Greetings Delegates,</p>

                    <p>It is with immense pleasure that I invite you to Greenwood High Junior Model United Nations for the year 2026.</p>

                    <p>Model United Nations is oftentimes perceived as simply a floor for debate where passionate teenagers use law and jargon to display their lexical proficiency amidst their peers, and while that is certainly a fundamental aspect of any conference there is so much more to what truly comprises the Model UN experience.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the hours of research and piles of legal documents, there exists an incredible community of smart, talented, dedicated, and kind individuals, ready to embrace any delegate who is bold enough to step into the world of MUN. The bonds formed through Model United Nations are unlike any other and they teach lessons far beyond any headline, textbook, or legal doctrine ever could.</p>

                    <p>Serving as the Director General for this edition of GWH Junior Model UN has allowed me to witness this conference evolve from just a simple proposal to a tangible reality. I sincerely believe that this conference will prove to be a fruitful experience, one that encourages delegates to delve deeper into the world of Model UN and the exciting challenges that it presents.</p>

                    <p>Whether this conference is your first or one of many, know that the nervousness is temporary, but the growth is permanent. Model UN has profoundly transformed who I am as a person and it is my genuine wish that GWHJMUN’26 proves to be just as transformative for each and every delegate.</p>

                    <p>I am certain that every delegate in this conference has the potential to accomplish remarkable work, and I hope that this conference is able to serve as the platform that each delegate deserves to truly flourish.</p>

                    <p>All the best.</p>
